# 🦊 3D Fox Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive 3D Developer Portfolio — a visually rich and technically advanced web application built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **Vite**. At the heart of this project is a fully animated 3D fox, showcasing my skills in frontend development, 3D rendering, and UI/UX design.

> This portfolio is not just a website — it's a hands-on demonstration of modern web technologies, smooth animations, and responsive design, crafted to leave a lasting impression.
